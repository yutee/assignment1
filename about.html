    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>Who?</h3>
        Hello world, I am <strong>Utibe Okon</strong>.
        Born in 1996 to Nigerian parents, I was also brought up in the nigerian way.
        I studied Computer Engineering in the University of Uyo, Uyo.
        I am passionate about computers and curious about how they work.
        I spend most of my time trying to figure things out with a computer,
        When I get tired, i resort to playing and following sports.

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        Despite spending most of my adult life with computers, I have always struggled to
        find focus in learning and mastering one of the many fields of computing. When I heard about 
        Alt school, a structured learning program, I thought it will be the key to mastering a field of computing 
        that would best suite me. I decided to enroll and follow through, and so far it has been everything I hoped for.

        <h3>Plans?</h3>
        I have always wanted to contribute my qouta to the fast emerging field of
        computing and technology, and I hope that by the end of my program with Alt School,
        I will be able to garner all the necesssary skills to do just that. I also plan to 
        reinvest time, money and effort in helping people around me grow.
